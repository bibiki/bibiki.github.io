Here is part of a thread by [Cultural Tutor](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1681792688159440902) on Twitter.

The last sentence in the thread above is 'The ideal Roman was simple, not beautiful' and the title to my post is 'Beautiful Romans, Humble Greeks'.

I think Cultural Tutor has this upside down. What I will say does not come from reading but rather from having lived in two different cities in Albania. I will also refer to the images Cultural Tutor has shared to make my point.

Note that modern day Albania, along with the two islands west of Italy, is the first region outside of the Italian peninsula to join the empire. In particular, Tirana's region. At least this [video indicates as much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GylVIyK6voU).

I am Albanian, but not from Albania. So, when I moved to Tirana, one of the first things that stood out for me was how they in Tirana use "how beautiful" as the most frequent expression of approval. Regardless of what virtue they praise, they will say "how beautiful". Also, 'having style' is like the ultimate virtue in Tirana, not only for women. Men, too. Of all ages.

From there, I moved south in Albania, in Vlore, not too far from modern day Greece. Soon as I moved in Vlore, I noticed that men dress differently. Women, too. Although, like everywhere, women want to enhance and show their beauty, both women and men in Vlore kind of tone it down, relative to Tirana, middle Albania.

This made me think. It all started as I was trying to understand the cultural differences between middle and southern Albania. For that purpose, I started considering a humility-beauty continuum, and that the south leans twoards humility as the more important value, while middle Albania leans towards beauty as the more important value.

Bceause from earlier experience I associated humility with Orthodox Christians, hence with Greeks, I concluded that Southern Albania are culturally Greek and Middle Albania are culturally Roman. Not that I know much of either civilization but those are the labels I used to emphasize that there is a difference in mentality between the two regions.

Now that Cultural Tutor made this post, I feel like my observation was not farfetched, although somewhat contradictory to their claims. I think their choice of images to compare the two confirms my observations. We have opposing interpretations of the images, though.

As the Tutor said, the Greek images show no specific person (humility). I do not know if they try to show an idealized face and body, as the Tutor claims, but by showing something that resambles a real person but that may not be a real person they elevate nobody above others (humility). Each of the greek images shown has the person looking down and sideways (humility). Also, the amount of detail in the sculptures is smaller than that in the Roman sculptures. The forms are simpler, closer to straight lines. (artist's humility).

On the other hand, the Roman images show sculptures built with very fine detail (not to say lack of humility as that sounds funny, but there does not seem to be any concern with simplicity). Also, the Romans seem to have tried to show the true, real person without worrying whether there could be anything better. The strong facial features are at least an appeal to our eyes, if not an expression of beauty. The images also seem to show well shaved faces, indicating that Roman men practiced some grooming. Unlike the Greek images, their heads seem to be either shaven or well kempt. Again, grooming.

Now, I am sure that Greeks valued beauty, but I do not believe they thought beauty is what humans should aspire to become. Rather, I believe they thought beautiful people look down and sideways. Romans, they looked straight in your face.

Also, two of the Greek stereotypes on barbarians were precisely that barbarians love luxury and are effeminate (I'd say beauty is a feminine virtue). Hence, I would wager that Greeks derided Romans for their love of luxury before Romans having done Greeks so. Hence, I believe Romans were beautiful and wanted to show it. Greeks were simple and expected humans to know that as beautiful one may be, there always is an idealised form that is better yet humbly gazes downwards.

Finally, I may be completely wrong, but this post reminded me of these thoughts from a year and a half ago. By stating the exact opposite of my beliefs the post felt like an appeal to share my own thoughts on this.
