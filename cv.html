      <i>Vaiu</i></br>
      This was a three month project. The idea was to allow for online
      payments. It was envisioned as a joint venture with Post Office of
      Kosovo since the Post already has the legal requirements for
      accepting payments on behalf of merchants met.</div>

      <i>CallNow</i></br>
      I joined CallNow in May 2019. During my time with them, I worked
      on a user management system. CallNow runs a few online gaming
      applications and wanted to have a centralized user management
      system that would be shared by the games they offer.

      <i>Vizah.ch</i></br>
      I worked for Vizah.ch for over eight months. I started working for
      Vizah in July 2018 and have worked for two of it’s clients, namely
      Clariant and Armacom. I have served for both clients as a team
      leader – for Clariant, we worked on a crawling project that is built
      on top of Norconex (a crawling framework that we’d configure
      using xml files), and for Armacom we worked on a couple of Java
      EE based applications that Armacom has developed for Roche. The
      applications allow geographically distributed research
      organizations to share equipment that are otherwise too expensive
      for an organization to own.

      <i>Timeframe</i></br>
      I joined Timeframe in February, 2018, as a team leader where I led
      a team consisting of two junior developers and myself. The goal
      was to build a Java development team. In pursuit of that goal, we
      built a piece of software for a call center also owned by the owner
      of Timeframe. In addition to my responsibilities in my team, I also
      helped another team inside Timeframe with their project. The
      project was named ActiBook. It was a web based application that
      would allow for offering and taking online courses. My involvement
      was mostly around advising the team and helping with client’s
      requests around application monitoring tools, dockerization, and
      researching technologies the client would ask the team to use
      (KeyCloak – an off the shelf user management system).

      <i>EPAM Systems</i></br>
      I was part of EPAM since November 2014 until December 2015. I
      was part of the group of people that have been hired on what has
      mostly been referred to as "UBS Bench". After the first three
      months on bench, I was moved to UBS facilities where I worked on
      a monitoring tool consisting of the backend that exposes a SOAP
      based web service and its' GUI client built on top of Vaadin
      framework. I worked on both. The goal was to gather health check
      data on other mission critical applications running on a list of up to
      80 servers. In retrospect, we were building web apps that would do
      exactly what Kubernetes does – help with discovery, maintain
      number of instances, alert about instance health status, and such.

      MSU is an online payment solution offering a secure, easy and

      payment tool with rich API support and allows payments to be
      initiated from multiple access points i.e. Web, Mobile, ERP/CRM
      systems and email. I was responsible for its' page that allows

      <i>AdaptivIT</i></br>
      I was involved in building a mobile application to facilitate the work
      of sales forces. Specifically, it would allow sellers to take orders,
      keep stock, and communicate with a remote server to submit
      orders. This was built with ActionScript and the Flex framework.

      <i>Codex</i></br>
      I was in Codex for a two-week, four hours a day, internship. During
      this period, we were extracting information from various German
      web sites. I built two Java classes. One to extract the html from the
      sites and the other to extract the information of interest based on
      regular expressions that I’d build in accordance with the
      information format in each site. After two weeks, they offered me
      a job but I had to turn it down due to working hours interfering
      with my intention to continue attending lectures in university.

      In ProCredit Bank, I was responsible for evaluating client’s credit

      defend my decision to issue or not the loan in a committee.
