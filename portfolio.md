#### [Benjalin](https://github.com/bibiki/benjalin)

Benjalin is a mobile application I built based on Benjamin Franklin's plan for self improvement. It is written with JavaScript.
In addition, I have written this application as a desktop application using python. The desktop version may be found [here](https://github.com/bibiki/benjalin_py).

#### [GUI Password Manager](https://github.com/bibiki/benjalin-pm)

I started this password manager as an exercise but ended up using it since 2016. It is written in Java and makes use of Swing framework for GUI development.

#### [Hands-in Development with Java](https://github.com/bibiki/benjalin-pm)

[Here I wrote](https://benjalin.gumroad.com/l/fapnd) a book where I show how to write a command line password manager with Java. I first show how to build the command line version of it then rapidly turn it into a web application. After that, I write another command line utility that also serves as a password manager but this one interacts with the web application built earlier. I complete the book by adding encryption/decryption functionality for the initial command line password manager. At this point, I also expand the password manager to allow for putting passwords into the clipboard for when the user wants to use a selected password and then overwrite the contents of the clipboard 15 seconds therafter to prevent others from finding passwords in the clipboard by pasting its contents.
