#### [Benjalin](https://github.com/bibiki/benjalin)
Benjalin is a mobile application I built based on Benjamin Franklin's plan for self improvement. It is written with JavaScript.
In addition, I have written this application as a desktop application using python. The desktop version may be found [here](https://github.com/bibiki/benjalin_py).

I started this password manager as an exercise but ended up using it since 2016. It is written in Java and makes use of Swing framework for GUI development.
